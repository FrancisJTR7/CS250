Interpreting user needs and implementing them: User needs are interpreted by gathering feedback, conducting interviews, and analyzing requirements to create actionable goals. Creating user stories helps by breaking down these needs into small, specific tasks that developers can implement, ensuring the final product aligns with user expectations.

Approaching program development: Developing programs involves breaking projects into manageable tasks, focusing on iterative delivery, and consistently seeking feedback. In the future, I hope to incorporate Agile processes like daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives to ensure adaptability and continuous improvement.

Being a good team member: A good team member in software development communicates effectively, supports collaboration, and is open to feedback. They contribute to shared goals by being reliable, proactive, and focused on the teamâ€™s success over individual achievements.
